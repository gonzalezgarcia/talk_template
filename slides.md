# Slidev Neversink Theme

:: content ::

Neversink is theme for education and academic presentations.  It is designed to be bright, flat, minimal, and easy to read.  It is based on the default Slidev theme but with some additional features and color schemes that have reference in the [metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) Beamer theme among others.

It is named for the [Neversink River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neversink_River) for absolutely no discernable reason.

layout: default

# Why use it?


- Neversink has several configurable ==layouts== that build upon the Slidev defaults and which make it easier to quickly throw together common slide layouts without having to write a lot of custom CSS/HTML.

- It has a variety of ==color themes== to choose from that make your visual identity more coherent. 


- It also has some whimsical elements like movie-style scrolling credits, animated speech bubbles, and admonitions that make your presentations more memorable.

- It strives to be well documented and easy to use! 


 You can find the source code on [GitHub](http://github.com/gureckis/slidev-theme-neversink).

# How to install


The theme depends on Slidev.  So you need to have that [installed first](https://sli.dev/guide/install).  Then you can install the theme with npm:

```bash
npm install slidev-theme-neversink
```

Then create a slidev markdown file (e.g., `slides.md`) and add the theme to the frontmatter of your first slide:

```md
---
theme: neversink
---
```


---
layout: default
---

# Color schemes

In many parts of the theme you can use the color schemes to help choose matching colors for your slides.  For example, we can make a slide with a sticky note using the `rose-light` color scheme, the `sky` color scheme, or the `amber-light` color scheme:

<StickyNote color="rose-light" textAlign="left" width="100px" v-drag="[122,253,180,180,-10]">

Hello, I'm a **redish sticky note** using `rose-light`.
</StickyNote>
<StickyNote color="green-light" textAlign="left" width="180px"  v-drag="[650,253,180,180,-9]">

Hello, I'm a **yellowish sticky note** using `amber-light`.
</StickyNote>


---
layout: side-title
color: emerald-light
align: rm-lm
titlewidth: is-2
---

<StickyNote color="emerald-light" textAlign="left" width="180px"  v-drag="[719,291,180,180,16]">

Don't worry if you don't understand all the details, yet we are still talking about **color schemes**.
</StickyNote>

# Color schemes


:: content ::

Or we can use the `emerald-light` scheme in a slide layout to set the overall color and style of a slide with a matching sticky note:

```md
---
layout: side-title
color: emerald-light
align: rm-lm
titlewidth: is-3
---
```

---
layout: top-title-two-cols
color: amber-light
align: l-lt-lt

# Two things about layouts



:: left ::

There are two important parts of slides to know about.

## Frontmatter 

First is **frontmatter**, which are configuration options
that appear at the start of each slide (see [Slidev docs](https://sli.dev/guide/syntax#frontmatter-layouts)).  These configure things like
alignment, color, and spacing:

```md
---
layout: top-title
color: sky
align: l
---
```

:: right ::

# Slots 

The other aspect is **slots**.  Slots are a basic part of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots.html).  In Slidev slots can be marked using `:: slotname ::` and then filled in with content.  For example, the `:: left ::` and `:: right ::` slots on this slide are filled with content.

Slots effectively help you map parts of your slide to different parts of a layout.  The most common case is to say which content appears in the left column and which appears in the right column. But different layouts can have different slots and different content.

# This is the `cover` layout

:: note ::

<div class="fw-100" >

\* Optional `:: note ::` slot for mentioning ==notes== at the bottom.

</div>

---
layout: default
---

# This is the `default` layout

This is kind of the basic slide.  The main content is interpreted as markdown and rendered in the center of the slide.  

Speaking of markdown, you can use markdown to make things **bold** or *italic* or even `code` like `this`.  In **Neversink** you can also ==highlight things using the double equals signs like this==
thanks to the `markdown-it-mark` plugin.

Of course you can make bullet lists:

- Hi
- There

Also there's a little helper class `ns-c-tight` you can add to make the bullet spacing a bit tighter:

<div class="ns-c-tight">

- Hi
- There
- I need space
</div>

---
layout: section
color: indigo
---

# The `section` layout
<hr>
It has a `hr` which is color matched to the color scheme.  For example, this slide is using the `navy` color scheme and the line is white.

---
layout: section
color: indigo
---

<div class="w-2/3 ml-30">

# The `section` layout
<hr>

<span class='text-amber-300'>
You can use HTML and inline CSS to modify the look and feel.
</span>


</div>

---
layout: quote
color: red-light
quotesize: text-xs
authorsize: text-2xs
author: "XX XXX"
---

"This is a quote slide.  It has a frontmatter option of `quote` which is the text that appears in the quote box and `author` and options for the size of the text(`quotesize: text-2xl` and `authorsize: text-l`).  I feel it is a little uninspired but might save you some time."

:: title ::

# `two-cols-title`

:: left ::

This is `layout: two-cols-title`. 

- There are three slots: `:: title ::`, `:: left ::`, and `:: right ::` along with the default which is implicit before any named slots.

- It additionally provides three configuration options in the slide YAML front matter:
  `color`, `columns` and `align`.

:: right ::

- `color` is the color scheme.

- `columns` is the relative spacing given to the left versus right column. The overall space is divided into 12 columns. Instructions like `is-5` will give 5 units to the left and 7 to the right.

- The <code>align</code> parameter determines how the columns look. The notation is for example
  <code>align: l-cm-cm</code>. The first part is for the header, the second for the left column, the third part is for the right column. The first letter is (<code>c</code> for center, <code>l</code> for left, <code>r</code> for right), the second letter
  is vertical alignment (<code>t</code> for top, <code>m</code> for middle, <code>b</code> for bottom). Only c/l/r works for the header.

Plain javascript:

console.log('Hello, World!')
```

Plain Python:

```py
print(int(2+2))
```

Highlight lines 2 and 3:

```ts {2,3}
function helloworld() {
  console.log('Hello, World!')
  console.log('Hello, World!')
  console.log('Hello, World!')
}
```

Crazy clicking through

```ts {2,3|5|all}
function helloworld() {
  console.log('Hello, World!')
  console.log('Hello, World!')
  console.log('Hello, World!')
  console.log('Hello, World!')
  console.log('Hello, World!')

```

You can even edit the code in the browser

```py ts {monaco}
print(int(2+2))
```

You can even run the code in the browser

```ts {monaco-run} {showOutputAt:'+1'}
function distance(x: number, y: number) {
  return Math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
}
console.log(distance(3, 4))
```
